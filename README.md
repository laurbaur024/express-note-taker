# Express Note Taker

## Activity

- For this activity I created the back end functionality and connected it to the front end so that a user can write notes, save notes, and delete notes on this application.

## User Instructions

- To save a note write a title for your note as well as some details to describe the note.
- Once done, hit the save button in the top right corner.
- Click on a note on the left to see what it says. 
- To write a new note, hit the plus sign in the top right.
- Hit the red trash can to delete the note.
- Your notes will persist through reloads and exiting the webpage with the help of the dependecy Express.
